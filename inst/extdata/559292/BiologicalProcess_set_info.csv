This occurs by a ribozymic mechanism where the intron sequence forms a distinct 3D structure, characteristic of Group II introns and containing splice site consensus sequences, that is involved in catalyzing the splicing reactions, though protein factors are also required in vivo. Splicing occurs by a series of two transesterification reactions (mechanistically similar to those for splicing of nuclear mRNAs) initiated by a bulged adenosine residue within the intron sequence as the initiating nucleophile. The intron is excised as a lariat. [GOC:krc, PMID:11377794]",2,http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000373,2023-05-10,http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/GO/goa/YEAST/goa_yeast.gaf.gz

Initiation of microautophagy is defined as the point where liquid-ordered microdomains are formed at sites of engulfment, that requires S. cerevisiae Atg32p and Atg21p, as well as Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) sterol transporter proteins, Ncr1p and Npc2p. This is followed by redistribution of Atg14p from ER exit sites onto liquid-ordered vacuole membrane domains through interaction with stabilized AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and together with Atg6p facilities docking and internalization of lipid droplets (LDs) at sites of invagination.
