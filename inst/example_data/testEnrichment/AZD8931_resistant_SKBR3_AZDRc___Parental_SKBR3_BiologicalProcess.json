Exocytosis can occur either by full fusion, when the vesicle collapses into the plasma membrane, or by a kiss-and-run mechanism that involves the formation of a transient contact, a pore, between a granule (for exemple of chromaffin cells) and the plasma membrane. The latter process most of the time leads to only partial secretion of the granule content. Exocytosis begins with steps that prepare vesicles for fusion with the membrane (tethering and docking) and ends when molecules are secreted from the cell.","size":93,"linkout":"http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006887"},{"gene.set":"GO:0006888","pval":0.398816694544481,"adj.pval":0.740750986845589,"observed":47,"items":["O15155","Q96MW5","O60763","P12259","O75379","Q15436","Q9Y296","P02549","Q96KX2","Q5BJH7","P18085","Q9BVK6","Q14789","O43237","Q13409","O75865","O14966","O75340","Q12893","Q9NSY0","P54920","O94855","Q5JRA6","Q9HAT1","Q14746","P07225","O14579","Q14393","Q6PI25","Q5T215","Q9Y6G9","Q70SY1","P01308","Q75T13","Q96JE7","Q9Y3B3","P55072","Q9UP83","O95487","Q9H5V9","Q9Y282","Q15363","Q9H0U4","P24390","Q9H9E3","Q9UJW0","O15498","Q7Z392","Q02388","Q86XR7","Q14204","Q8NHH9","Q8TF30","Q6ZVE7","Q8NI22","P51572","O94979","Q8IX95","Q9HCU5","Q9Y5R8","Q96AJ9","Q13445","Q9UHQ4","P53992","Q9P003","P53634","Q1A5X7","P53621","O00399","Q9UBF2","Q01082","O15027","Q53F39","A4FU28","P00451","O95486","P01009","Q9Y4L1","P16157","Q13561","O15020","P49755","Q9NYM9","Q96BZ9","P47755","Q12907","Q9Y678","P0DI81","P61163","Q92538","Q969X5","Q53G59","P47756","Q96JB2","Q96IW7","P33947","Q13190","P00740","Q9Y3A6","Q9UL33","P52907","Q8WW62","O75396","Q9Y2L5","P08174","P08709","Q9UHY1","Q92734","O43731","Q9UBP0","P62820","O14576","P61019","Q9NRC6","Q15643","P04070","O95070","Q9UEU0","Q9P0L0","P83436","Q9UBV8","Q9BQQ3","P35606","Q6UWH6","P48444","Q9H0V9","Q08379","P11277","Q9Y2V7","P42261","P02818","Q96RT6","Q8N6H7","Q01484","Q9Y3Q3","P61923","O95292","P56962","Q8TBE1","P46459","Q96FJ2","Q8WTW3","Q86UF2","Q9UBR2","Q9H254","O43617","O75935","Q9Y5U9","Q9P299","Q96RQ1","O95249","Q9BRL7","Q9NR31","P53618","Q8IX94","Q9HD47","Q8WVT3","Q9HD26","Q13813","Q96PC5","Q8IUR0","O43264","P22891","P0CG41","Q86SZ2","Q8WVM8","P49257","O95406","P15514","O14653","Q6DD88","Q12955","Q9NZ32","Q9BTE1","Q9Y6B6","Q13618","P15328","P01135","Q9NZ43","Q7Z7H5","Q14203","Q8N6T3","A4D2H0","P13987","P00742","P0DI82","Q9NP61","P00734","P63167"],"afc":-1.20506686303875,"name":"endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport","description":"The directed movement of substances from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, mediated by COP II vesicles.

The execution phase is the last step of an apoptotic process, and is typically characterized by rounding-up of the cell, retraction of pseudopodes, reduction of cellular volume (pyknosis), chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), plasma membrane blebbing and fragmentation of the cell into apoptotic bodies. When the execution phase is completed, the cell has died.","size":555,"linkout":"http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006915"},{"gene.set":"GO:0006919","pval":0.851848446043231,"adj.pval":0.940700509500965,"observed":10,"items":["Q13158","P06307","P49662","P48023","O75146","Q9HBF5","P61604","P43005","Q99801","P42575","O00291","Q9NZJ5","O00220","P29466","Q14790","P09668","P25116","P50591","Q9NZJ7","P55072","Q9NR28","P25445","Q9UMX3","Q92934","Q9UKL3","Q00994","P63244","P29590","Q96A26","Q4VXA5","Q9H6Z9","Q07812","Q9HD36","P05109","P10636","Q6UXS9","Q9Y6N7","Q96PG8","O15244","P01375","Q9C000","Q71UM5","P59046","P01138","Q13546","Q5JSQ8","Q16342","Q01955","P37231","O14727","Q969V5","Q93084","O14763","Q9HB75","P84022","P13726","Q9P0U3","P55957","O95831","Q96QB1","P10809","Q92851","P51878","P37840","Q9NPP4","P51397","P55211","P51575","Q5QJU3","Q9Y239","Q92688","Q9Y2G2","Q15628","P06702","Q9NWB7","Q13571","P47989","Q9BXK5","P78560","O15519","Q9ULZ3","O60674","O95150","O75340","P06239","Q12933","Q13794"],"afc":-0.64542058983106,"name":"activation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process","description":"Any process that initiates the activity of the inactive enzyme cysteine-type endopeptidase in the context of an apoptotic process.","size":88,"linkout":"http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006919"},{"gene.set":"GO:0006924","pval":0.478112017029359,"adj.pval":0.763912884806205,"observed":1,"items":["P62753","P25445","P31749","Q96EY1"],"afc":0.236350571876404,"name":"activation-induced cell death of T cells","description":"A T cell apoptotic process that occurs towards the end of the expansion phase following the initial activation of mature T cells by antigen and is triggered by T cell receptor stimulation and signals transmitted via various surface-expressed members of the TNF receptor family such as Fas ligand, Fas, and TNF and the p55 and p75 TNF receptors.","size":5,"linkout":"http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006924"},{"gene.set":"GO:0006930","pval":0.530953520379715,"adj.pval":0.797894019699556,"observed":1,"items":["Q14247","Q9Y5K6","P16333","O95631","Q9H244","A0MZ66","O60890","O00560"],"afc":-1.31992809395211,"name":"substrate-dependent cell migration, cell extension","description":"The formation of a cell surface protrusion, such as a lamellipodium or filopodium, at the leading edge of a migrating cell.","size":9,"linkout":"http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006930"},{"gene.set":"GO:0006935","pval":0.689059049865945,"adj.pval":0.874671896687167,"observed":1,"items":["P25025","Q9P296","P19875","P09341","P48061","P09038","P32004","P49238","P00749","P19971","P33241","Q9Y271","O75747","P78423","P32246","P28482","P55773","P07332","P60022","Q9NPC1","Q16663","P16591","P51677","P13501","O15444","P55774","Q9Y5Y4","O00175","P42830","Q16539","Q92608","Q16581","P41597","Q8TAZ6","Q03405","P21462","O14960","Q92583","P04196","P42338","Q99616","P51685","P22362","O00626","O00590","O00421","Q9Y258","P80075","Q9UK33","P11233","O43889","O95715","P21453","P12724","P80098","Q99969","Q9NRJ3","P10153","Q13393","Q04941","P01031","O00182","P51684","P23352","Q8NHP6","P25089","P13500","P10145","P10147","Q07325","P51671","O60733","Q8N5G2","Q99788","P78556","P59665","Q15311","Q4VCS5","Q96FZ5","Q8IZ96","Q9H2A7","P25105","P46094","P15407","P34982","P51681","P80162","P51679","Q02750","Q9HBL7","Q19T08","Q9NPB9","O00622","P16150","O15467","P21730","O14625","Q9Y4X3","P51686","P01112","Q96MX0","Q8IZV2","P05546","P25090","O15263","P55160","Q9Y4F9","P02778","Q13822","Q96DZ9","Q9HC23"],"afc":0.0245754042289192,"name":"chemotaxis","description":"The directed movement of a motile cell or organism, or the directed growth of a cell guided by a specific chemical concentration gradient.

transduction","description":"The cellular process in which a signal is conveyed to trigger a change in the activity or state of a cell. Signal transduction begins with reception of a signal (e.g. a ligand binding to a receptor or receptor activation by a stimulus such as light), or for signal transduction in the absence of ligand, signal-withdrawal or the activity of a constitutively active receptor. Signal transduction ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors located on the surface of the cell and signaling via molecules located within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is restricted to events at and within the receiving cell.","size":1033,"linkout":"http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007165"},{"gene.set":"GO:0007166","pval":0.726594638864553,"adj.pval":0.892444405468121,"observed":8,"items":["Q9HAR2","P04083","P49682","P33681","P07766","Q9Y6J0","O75762","P78356","P04234","A0A5B0","P08637","Q13733","Q00978","Q9UI08","Q99665","O14836","A0A1B0GX95","Q6BAA4","P05111","O60496","O95859","Q9Y6Y9","P26715","P01563","Q9BZR6","A0A5A2","P04435","P48546","P20963","P00533","P07550","Q16619","Q8WXG6","P07359","P04626","Q92956","Q9H2E6","A0A075B6N2","P51681","P32241","Q9NZQ7","P13164","P13224","Q96PE1","P37198","Q9Y653","P41587","P05305","Q01955","O95665","P28482","A0A087X0K7","O75022","P16860","P09693","Q8IZP9","P47900","P21709","A0A0K0K1C4","Q92851","Q96F46","A0A1B0GX78","A0A075B6N4","P12318","Q8IZF3","A0A577","P30559","P12314","A0A539","P01236","Q8WXG9","Q8IZF2","A0A1B0GX31","P35613","O75019","P42702","P02778","Q7L513","Q07912","P78552","P01574","O75023","P08575","A0A597","O95490","Q99705","A0A075B6L6","Q13241","O00220","A0A0J9YXY3","P34998","Q14246","Q99836","Q5T601","Q96P31","Q86Y34","P25090","P16066","Q5UAW9","O00241","Q15109","Q6DN72","P16284","Q13490","P01730","Q9ULV8","Q96LA5","O43927","Q6VN20","Q6UX52","A0A1B0GXF2","A0A0K0K1G6","P0DPF7","P13987","P50591","P08581","Q99704","A0A0A0MS03","P14138","Q9UEW3","A0A0K0K1D8","A0A0A0MS05","Q9NZS2","Q13324","O15218","A0A075B6N1","Q9UHP7","P00734","P61278","P58753","A0A0A6YYG3","P10523","Q6UWB1","Q12866","A0A0A6YYG2","Q8IZF5","P01112","P25391","P32246","P08173","Q13158","Q8NCJ5","P48357","P30988","Q99873","Q6QNK2","Q99572","P47872","P01589","P48729","Q96LA6","P49190","A0A1B0GX51","P13500","P27361","P47871","O75015","P26842","Q92637","P31995","P16473","Q8IZF6","Q86SQ4","P12319","P24530","Q9P0M4","A0A087WV62","P06729","O14514","A0A0A0MS06","P61366","Q9UBD9","A0A0C4DH59","O60241","P55040","P38484","A0A0K0K1C0","P25025","P14174","Q8NC01","P08476","Q8IZF7","O14763","Q7Z7M1","P30411","P31994","Q16602","P01019","P01031","A0A5B6","A0A5A6","O95976","P43220","Q9UMR7","Q86SQ3","A0A0K0K1E9","Q9BQ51","P22681","Q13489","Q9UBN6","A0A0K0K1A3","A0A087X0M5","Q8IWK6","Q8NB16","A0A589","Q8N423","Q9H0E9","Q8IZF4","A0A584","Q96E93","A0A0A0MS04","Q9Y271","Q96T91","P01579","O43603","O60242","Q93033","Q7Z6M3","P42081","P18627","Q96QZ7","P20800","A0A0K0K1B3","Q9P126","P16150","P14778","Q6NYC1","Q96LB2","O95551","P16871","Q02643","A0A5B7","A0A578","O94910","P32320","A0A075B6N3","Q9UHX3","A0A0B4J1U6","P27987","P01733","Q03431","Q86SQ6","Q14790","A0A599","Q86UN3","A0A0A6YYK4","Q9HBH9","Q12918","P48551","A0A1B0GX49","A0A0K0K1G8","P08571","A0A1B0GX68","A0A0J9YX75","Q92990","O15444","Q9BY15","P25024","Q14289","O95838","O75689","Q96K78","Q93038","Q9HBW9","Q99933","Q86Y01","Q96S59","P50052","P56159","Q96PJ5","Q8NER1","P10747","A0A0K0K1A5","P41586","A0A576","P01732","Q9Y336","P48960","A0A0A6YYD4","Q16539","P32239","A0A0B4J2E0","Q96RD9","P07307"],"afc":-0.780221661524514,"name":"cell surface receptor signaling pathway","description":"A series of molecular signals initiated by activation of a receptor on the surface of a cell.

protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway","description":"A series of molecular signals that proceeds with an activated receptor promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP on the alpha-subunit of an associated heterotrimeric G-protein complex. The GTP-bound activated alpha-G-protein then dissociates from the beta- and gamma-subunits to further transmit the signal within the cell. The pathway begins with receptor-ligand interaction, or for basal GPCR signaling the pathway begins with the receptor activating its G protein in the absence of an agonist, and ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. transcription.

together.","size":20,"linkout":"http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030150"},{"gene.set":"GO:0030154","pval":0.181372817675908,"adj.pval":0.679179680230264,"observed":36,"items":["Q1MX18","Q9HCH3","Q96M69","P43699","Q8IUM7","P31371","Q5H9L4","Q6WRI0","Q8TB22","Q9Y696","Q96EP5","P09529","Q3YBM2","P20794","P51636","Q01954","P08476","Q8TC57","O95238","P22492","Q71H61","P19793","P62081","Q14774","Q13470","Q8N5J4","Q16739","P12034","P56539","Q7Z6Z7","Q8N6I1","O00571","O60481","Q96EK5","Q96A49","Q6SZW1","P43403","Q9Y5A6","Q96T25","Q01534","Q9HBB8","Q15464","Q5GLZ8","Q9NVM4","Q6ZQN5","P37275","Q9Y547","Q03014","Q12948","P24468","P78426","Q6DKJ4","Q06413","O43463","Q6PRD7","O95409","Q6P6C2","Q9UGV2","Q8WWU5","Q99504","Q96N23","Q5TAP6","Q92832","P15884","Q06945","Q9UPE1","Q8N9W6","P07332","O95257","Q9Y2W6","A2RU54","Q8IUH3","Q6J9G0","Q16527","Q13461","Q02078","O00291","Q9BXT5","Q08999","Q13133","Q4G0N8","P48431","P78395","Q14993","Q9NQI0","Q9UHJ3","Q07912","Q9NS18","P21145","O95183","P42685","Q96LR9","A6NI15","O95750","Q12952","P10588","Q5T4F7","P26718","Q2M1K9","P08922","Q05066","O43320","P11473","P56177","Q19T08","Q86UR5","Q8N427","P05230","O95741","Q01543","Q9BR10","Q7Z3S9","Q12951","P46379","Q14576","Q9UJG1","O76093","O60674","Q07687","Q8NEC5","P02538","Q13501","A6NCS4","Q6ZN32","Q92729","Q86YR5","Q5JUK2","Q8NCR6","P0CW01","Q8TDB8","P32856","Q86VP6","Q96TA1","Q9NWH7","Q07869","Q7RTU7","Q9H3C7","P98160","Q9NR90","Q6ZMY3","Q6PIF6","P15036","Q16352","Q96JY0","O75293","O15198","Q86VD1","Q6PUV4","Q15847","Q99932","P07947","Q01538","O43186","Q9H0Z9","Q96PN8","Q9H8Y8","Q6A555","Q6ZW33","Q9BYV2","P85037","Q13404","Q16181","Q9UNE0","O95416","O43541","Q9HCT0","P0CV99","P48634","P78545","Q6ZUB0","Q8N5V2","O96005","P08620","Q02363","O60522","A1X283","Q14990","P29279","Q9Y3Q7","Q9NZM3","Q8WVJ9","Q9BXL5","Q9BU40","Q9Y603","Q9H0C2","Q9NZP6","P28749","Q9HCE7","Q9BXJ9","Q9UJU5","Q8IWX7","Q9NVE4","Q8N9I0","Q13685","P35713","O15523","P49116","Q2KHN1","P04049","Q5M9Q1","Q9UKY1","Q9NZC4","O60258","Q9BX46","O95677","Q86W24","Q6T4R5","P57052","Q05397","Q32MQ0","Q9NP31","A8MTJ6","P41970","Q15915","P34820","Q01892","A0A1W2PQ73","Q96AQ6","Q86W54","Q5HYW2","P48443","P52952","Q16676","Q5T0L3","P52594","Q13239","O43809","P10767","Q12841","Q15796","Q9H869","Q8NI99","Q9Y5X4","Q14994","Q8WW38","Q8NER5","Q9BUP3","P07948","Q9H9C1","Q9Y466","P18405","Q92988","Q13555","P28324","Q96D98","Q02297","Q03181","Q6WN34","Q9UPZ6","P21741","Q9H2Z4","Q6VB84","P15144","Q13882","P13056","Q8N475","Q9UD57","Q02080","Q9NU39","Q9P2T0","Q9P206","Q14541","Q5VU36","P15531","Q99542","Q9HBH7","P06400","O14727","O43316","P29350","P17036","Q587J7","Q03060","Q6MZW2","Q9Y219","Q6UQ28","P16591","Q8N2R0","P10826","P09038","O14627","Q15723","O14966","O00321","Q9H4F8","Q7Z745","Q8IYM1","Q9NVP2","Q9UPW0","Q9NX45","Q7Z333","Q12950","Q86VQ6","P0CW00","P58012","Q86VW1","Q6UXB2","Q86SG3","O95633","P19971","P55317","Q9BXT8","O00358","P41162","Q8NHV5","Q9H3Y6","Q99466","Q9Y6L7","Q14190","P17947","Q9GZM5","Q8N8V4","Q5VVP1","P60985","Q9H7T0","B2RXH4","Q9NQZ3","Q9Y508","Q7RTU1","Q5BKX8","O95096","Q9UJV9","Q6ZUB1","Q7Z5A4","Q96I82","Q502X0","Q9NP95","O95294","P11308","P49763","Q03112","Q96TC7","P78367","Q9H3U1","P56178","P31749","Q7Z5Y6","Q496M5","A6NHT5","Q5VV16","P61366","Q8IWB4","O60248","Q99801","Q9H9J4","Q2M3G0","P61247","Q6NUN7","Q08AF3","P41161","P59282","Q99626","P08493","Q9Y2K1","Q58G82","O15520","Q14995","Q96QR8","Q9H4I2","Q15797","Q58F21","Q96E22","Q99607","Q15139","Q9NYL2","Q9ULP0","Q96RI1","P27216","Q8TAA3","P10276","P0CV98","P35716","P49454","A6NG13","Q9GZV9","Q9BWV2","P81133","P51451","O60519","Q9Y6E2","Q13939","Q8WWH4","Q8N1W1","Q01453","Q14781","P14921","Q8N8Y5","P43268","P32519","P41212","O00139","Q15834","P43405","Q504Y2","P10827","Q9C056","Q6UWN8","O75344","Q15270","Q9UL49","Q96M53","P50549","Q8TDN7","Q9BXB7","O43897","Q6ZT98","Q02535","Q9H8V3","Q8NBF1","Q6UW56","Q99426","Q8TAU0","P04553","P12931","P55318","P47928","Q99717","P13631","Q8TAX0","A7MD48","Q15389","P27540","Q9Y520","Q8WTS1","Q92838","P80370","Q9Y644","P05111","Q8IYX1","Q8IX07","O60479","A6NKD2","Q9BZQ2","Q7Z5H3","Q5TAT6","Q86UU5","Q7Z3Z4","Q8WW33","Q9UJX0","P21781","Q9UN36","P20393","Q13285","P37231","Q9NNZ6","P20382","Q7L513","P10589","Q9Y261","P41134","Q99081","Q99969","Q7Z5L4","P06241","P51114","O15370","P56179","Q96L12","Q9C0C7","A2VEC9","Q8TF32","Q9HBX9","O75469","P10828","Q9BY67","Q13642","Q2TAA8","Q5VYV0","P13497","Q9NPE6","Q12824","Q9C009","P55075","Q9H5I1","Q13485","Q9P0K8","Q8TAG5","A0A1W2PRP0","O15522","Q9UPW8","Q9HD15","P31213","P00533","Q8WVL7","Q8NDG6","Q14289","Q5D1E8","Q2M2E3","Q9NSA1","P0C874","Q9NS00","Q8TBZ2","Q9BQE9","Q99853","Q7Z7C8","Q6ZRH7","P78362","P28702","O43638","Q14141","P55055","P84022","Q3SYB3","Q8TD31","Q9H0D2","Q9BSW7","B4DYI2","Q5FVE4","Q9H0M4","Q99598","Q5SYE7","Q6ZQQ2","Q9BQG1","P19419","Q9H9S0","P04155","Q9Y651","Q14012","Q9H6I2","Q9UKW6","Q96PU9","P50548","Q7Z3Z3","P21579","Q03169","O00570","P47902","Q4G0J3","A0PJW8","Q99958","Q9Y6B2","Q9NR21","P09769","A6NJ46

The phosphorylation state regulates the association of specific complexes such as the capping enzyme or 3'-RNA processing machinery to the elongating RNA polymerase complex.","size":9,"linkout":"http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070816"},{"gene.set":"GO:0070828","pval":0.175826471522228,"adj.pval":0.679179680230264,"observed":1,"items":["Q9Y4K0","O95863","Q03112","Q96T68","Q9HAZ2","Q8WTS6","Q5SSJ5"],"afc":-3.28888465754824,"name":"heterochromatin organization","description":"Any process that results in the specification, formation or maintenance of the physical structure of eukaryotic heterochromatin, a compact and highly condensed form of chromatin.","size":8,"linkout":"http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070828"},{"gene.set":"GO:0070830","pval":0.703895634920566,"adj.pval":0.882354561081051,"observed":4,"items":["Q13177","Q68DX3","Q96B33","P33151","O00501","O15551","Q8N6F1","O95832","Q6IN97","Q8IY33","Q9BYG5","P41743","P56750","Q9BUF7","Q8N3R9","Q9BYG4","A6NM45","P56746","Q86UE4","Q8NI35","P78369","P16284","Q16625","O14493","P57739","Q12959","Q9BTW9","P56856","Q96AP7","O60895","P36404","Q5T2T1","P56748","Q96A59","P56880","Q8TEW0","O95500","Q9Y5I7","Q6ISB3","C9JDP6","O43815","Q8N4S9","Q9NPB6","O95471","Q8WUM4","O95484","O75508","H7C241","Q9H8V3","Q8N7P3","P11831","Q8WVV4","P25054","P55196","P56747","P51153","O96014"],"afc":-0.320837388172742,"name":"bicellular tight junction assembly","description":"The aggregation, arrangement and bonding together of a set of components to form a tight junction, an occluding cell-cell junction that is composed of a branching network of sealing strands that completely encircles the apical end of each cell in an epithelial sheet.","size":58,"linkout":"http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070830"},{"gene.set":"GO:0070836","pval":0.0685517642834586,"adj.pval":0.643548693940139,"observed":1,"items":["Q03135","Q9UNF0","P54851","P51636"],"afc":5.77564573784993,"name":"caveola assembly","description":"The aggregation, arrangement and bonding together of a set of components to form a caveola.
