# Workflow Dev

Steps: 

1. Run current workflow (check it works) (yes)
2. Substitute CAMERA for gene set enrichment (yes)
3. Ensure artifact is produced correctly (yes)
4. Update Acceptance Test (no)


```{r}
library(EnrichmentAnalysisStepR)
experiment_home = "/home/joseph/experiments/her_data_gsea_test"
gmt_folder = "/home/joseph/experiments/BKG_gmt_output_human/9606"

results = enrichment_workflow_step(experiment_home, 
                                   gmt_folder = gmt_folder,
                                   output_folder = file.path(experiment_home,"camera"),
                                   by = "Protein",
                                   method = "camera")
```
